DAPP Tokens Distribution
========================
The year-long DAPP token Generation Event began on February 26th, 2019 and will last until January 2020, for a total of 333 days. These 333 days will be split into 444 18-hour cycles, with each cycle receiving an allocation of 1,127,127 tokens.  

The DAPP tokens are distributed through two unique independent purchase tracks — the Instant Registration Track and the Regular Registration Track. At the end of each cycle, each one of the two Registration Tracks distributes 563,063.0630 DAPP tokens amongst that cycle’s participants, proportional to the amount of EOS sent by each purchaser in that cycle.
