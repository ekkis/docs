Claiming DAPP Tokens
====================

## Automatic
The auto claim mechanism does not require participants to push an action themselves to claim the tokens.  This is handled by the website automatically at the end of each cycle.

## Manual
The manual claim function is always available and participants can claim their DAPP Tokens immediately after the cycle ends by sending an explicit action depending on the track they selected.
