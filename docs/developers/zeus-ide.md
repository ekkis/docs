Zeus IDE
=====================

The Zeus IDE allows new developers to get up and running in mere minutes! It is based on [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/), a cloud-based tool for creating IDEs from git repos backed by Docker containers. All a you need to do is log in to Gitpod with your GitHub account and establish a new workspace based on the LiquidApps [Zeus IDE GitHub repo](https://github.com/liquidapps-io/zeus-ide). 

Behind the scenes, Gitpod executes the following:

- Automatically installs the Docker image, which already contains EOSIO, Zeus and many other tools
- Starts an EOSIO development node
- Generates a basic starting point for a project (using the Zeus SDK)
- Starts a LiquidApps development DSP
